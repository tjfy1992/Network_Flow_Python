A python implemenation of calculating the max flow of a flow network.
The implementation uses two algorithms: Simplex Algorithm(linear programming) and Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.

The project is run written in Pycharm for Windows. Python version is 3.7.4 x64, pytest version is 5.1.2.

To run the program with Simple Algorithm, run
runner.bat simplex

To run the program with Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, run
runner.bat Ford-Fulkerson
